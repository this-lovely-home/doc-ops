# Followups Post Initial Buildout

Capturing a few ideas to do as post followups from initial `0.1.0` release.

* Add CLI interface to invoke rendering functions so that we can send different fixture-paths, support for file-name conventions -- right now just output.pdf
* Begin work on math-problems / story-work
* Consider the default Page creation flag, maybe disable it as we begin work on the next renderer which will need to build a different set of title-pages
